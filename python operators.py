# python operators:
"""
operator is a specical symbol is used to perform an operation on operands
A------>
variable
A=----->variable initiazation
A=23--->variable declartion
A=B+C
A,B,C-->operands---
a operands is avariable
A=B+C

#the python oparetor are dividle into 7 types
#there are:
"""
1.Arithmetic 0perator
2.relational operator\comparison operator
3.logical operator
4.assigment oparetor
5.bitwise oparetor
6.identity oparetor
7.member ship oparetor

#Arithmetic oparetor:
"""
 An Arithmetic oparetor is used to perform some mathmetical \arithmetical oparetions the operators are +,-,/,//,%,*
 note:input ()is a function which takes input from user 
"""
a=int(input("enter a number:"))
b=int(input("enter a number"))
print("the addition",a+b)
print("the subtrsction",a-b)
print("the mulitiplication",a*b)
print("the division",a/b )
print("the quotient",a/b)#which return the quotieent
print("the floordivision",a//b)#which retuns the integeral quotional part in a division
print("the modulardivision",a%b)#which retuns the remaimder part before the decimal15
print("the power",a**b)#which returns thepower
